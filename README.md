# google-capstone-bellabeat

This is a capstone project in Google Data Analytics course where it is expected to analyse the data

In the project, I have applied the skills gathered from the course: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze and Share**

The dataset used for the project is [fitbit](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

The code is available in https://www.kaggle.com/code/dhanalakshmic/bellabeat-case-study where I have used R programming for Prepare, Process and Analyze phases

The share phas was achieved by using Tableau tool where a deep analysis was done with the data and published: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dhanalakshmi8752/viz/Bellabeat-CaseStudy_16500383994520/Slides
